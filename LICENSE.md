Individual Contributor License Agreement for “Integration” Repositories
January 2025

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Space Station OS project (the "Project"). To clarify the intellectual property license associated with contributions from individuals or entities, we require all contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This agreement ensures compliance with the license terms outlined below.
Please note that this agreement is limited to contributions made to repositories explicitly labeled as "Integration" within the Project. Contributions to repositories labeled as "Demo" or any other repositories are not subject to this agreement. For details, please refer to the specific license terms outlined in each repository.

The CLA is designed to protect you as a Contributor, as well as to safeguard the Project and its users. It does not alter your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. Your involvement helps advance the collaborative development of the Space Station OS and ensures a unified and scalable integration system for future space technologies.

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, we utilize an automated Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") management system powered by ACL Assistant. This ensures compliance with license terms while streamlining the contributor experience.
The CLA protects you as a Contributor, safeguarding your rights and supporting the collaborative development of the Space Station OS. By signing the CLA through ACL Assistant, you confirm that your contributions are compliant with the terms outlined below.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your Contributions (present and future) that you submit to the Space Station OS project (the "Project"). In return, the Project shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its collaborative and open-source principles. Except for the license granted herein to the Project and recipients of software distributed under the Project, You retain all rights, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.


1. Definitions
"You" (or "Your") refers to the copyright owner or the legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with the Space Station OS project (the "Project"). For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to direct or manage such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
"Contribution" refers to any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communications on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems managed by or on behalf of the Project, for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work. However, communications that are explicitly marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution" are excluded.

2. Grant of Copyright License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant the Space Station OS project (the "Project") and recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant the Project and recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work. This license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by the combination of your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. However, if any entity initiates patent litigation against you or any other entity (including cross-claims or counterclaims in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution or the Work to which you contributed constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work will terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Representation of Licensing Rights
You represent that you have the legal right to grant the licenses above. If your employer(s) have rights to intellectual property you create, including your Contributions, you represent that you have obtained permission to make Contributions on behalf of your employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project.

5. Representation of Original Work
You represent that all your Contributions are your original work (see Section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You also represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restrictions (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) that you are personally aware of and that are associated with any part of your Contributions.

6. Support for Contributions
You are not required to provide support for your Contributions unless you choose to do so. Support may be provided for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Submissions Not of Your Original Creation
If you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to the Project separately from any Contribution. You must identify the complete details of its source and any license or other restrictions (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware. The work must be conspicuously marked as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [name here]."

8. Notification of Changes
You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances you become aware of that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
